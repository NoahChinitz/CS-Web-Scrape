In our model, each arm's reward distribution is same for all agents, and rewards are drawn independently across agents and over time steps. In each round, agents choose an arm to play and subsequently send a message to their neighbors. The goal is to minimize cumulative regret averaged over the entire network. We propose a decentralized Bayesian multi-armed bandit framework that extends single-agent Bayesian bandit algorithms to the decentralized setting. Specifically, we study an information assimilation algorithm that can be combined with existing Bayesian algorithms, and using this, we propose a decentralized Thompson Sampling algorithm and decentralized Bayes-UCB algorithm. We analyze the decentralized Thompson Sampling algorithm under Bernoulli rewards and establish a problem-dependent upper bound on the cumulative regret. We show that regret incurred scales logarithmically over the time horizon with constants that match those of an optimal centralized agent with access to all observations across the network. Our analysis also characterizes the cumulative regret in terms of the network structure. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that our extensions of Thompson Sampling and Bayes-UCB incur lesser cumulative regret than the state-of-art algorithms inspired by the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm.  We implement our proposed decentralized Thompson Sampling under gossip protocol, and over time-varying networks, where each communication link has a fixed probability of failure.\n","BIO: Anusha Lalitha is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Electrical Engineering Department at Stanford University.

We exploit the synergy between both tasks through a shared inter-frame affinity matrix, which simultaneously models transitions between video frames at both the region- and pixel-levels. While region-level localization helps reduce ambiguities in fine-grained matching by narrowing down search regions; fine-grained matching provides bottom-up features to facilitate region-level localization. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods on a variety of visual correspondence tasks, including video-object and part-segmentation propagation, keypoint tracking, and object tracking.

Hyperspectral imaging can provide more information than color imaging for tasks such as tumor segmentation and crop monitoring, and 3D imaging can be useful for many robotics and biology applications.  However, such imaging systems are often prohibitively costly and bulky.  In my work, I utilize computational imaging, which is the co-design of optics and algorithms, to make very compact and cheap imagers that capture higher-dimensional information (3D and hyperspectral).  I have demonstrated cameras that encode 3D information (e.g. hyperspectral reflectance) in a single measurement, then recover the encoded volume by solving a compressive-sensing-based inverse problem. These cameras can be incredibly small, often requiring no lenses or moving parts, and can be inexpensive to fabricate.  While computational cameras could boost many machine learning tasks, machine learning methods can also be used to improve the reconstruction algorithms and the design of a computational camera itself.  I have shown that it’s possible to combine our knowledge of the imaging system physics along with deep learning to create physics-based networks that solve the imaging inverse problem.  These physics-based networks are faster than traditional approaches and require less training data than is needed by deep learning approaches (since we incorporate known physics into the network), enabling real-time image reconstructions.  As more images are directly used in machine learning pipelines, it is increasingly important to have cameras that are optimized to capture relevant features for tasks instead of optimized for image quality based on human-perception.

This lack of social presence is associated with increased attrition, reduced motivation to learn and thereby result ineffectiv elearning experience. Drawing on methods to establish effective communities of practice, we introduce rapid communities on MOOCs (RCOM), a four phase community building process which scaffolds social presence into MOOCs. RCOM groups students into loosely cohesive clusters, and then helps them self organize with leadership rolls and networking activities to cultivate social presence. An exploratory case study conducted to integrate RCoM to a course in MOOC platform which had over 15,000 registered learners. We evaluate the possibilities of RCoM to impend social presence in MOOC and surrounding challenges in this process. Through network and content analysis, we found that RCOM incubated social presence and establish communities of practices. This work provides early in-field evidence that social presence can be established in MOOCs atscale with minimal technical modification. \"Rapid Communities on MOOCs (RCoM)\" will trigger the value of social learning in MOOCs and act as a re-designed space for MOOC platforms.

For reconciling system-wide errors, I developed a comprehensive architecture that I call \"Anomaly Detection through Explanations (ADE).\"  The ADE architecture contributes an explanation synthesizer that produces an argument tree, which in turn can be traced and queried to determine the support of a decision, and to construct counterfactual explanations.

Pioneer transcription factors interact with DNA to open chromatin, which subsequently enables changes to gene expression during development, disease, or as a response to environmental stimuli. However, the regulation of DNA accessibility via the recruitment of transcription factors is difficult to understand in the context of the native genome because every genomic site is distinct in multiple ways. Here we introduce the Multiplexed Integrated Accessibility Assay (MIAA), a multiplexed parallel reporter assay which measures changes to genome accessibility as a result of the integration of synthetic oligonucleotide phrase libraries into a controlled, natively inaccessible genomic context. We apply MIAA to measure the effects of sequence motifs on cell type-specific DNA accessibility between mouse embryonic stem cells and embryonic stem cell-derived definitive endoderm cells, screening a total of 7,905 distinct phrases. MIAA is able to recapitulate differential accessibility patterns of 100-nt sequences derived from natively differential genomic regions, identifying the presence of E-box motifs common to epithelial-mesenchymal transition driver transcription factors in stem cell-specific accessible regions that become repressed during differentiation to endoderm. We further present causal evidence that a single binding motif for a key regulatory transcription factor is sufficient to open chromatin, and classify sets of stem cell-specific, endoderm-specific, and shared pioneer factor motifs. We also demonstrate that over-expression of two definitive endoderm transcription factors, Brachyury and FoxA2, results in changes to accessibility in phrases containing their respective DNA-binding motifs. Finally, we use MIAA results to explore the order of motif interactions and identify preferential motif ordering arrangements that appear to have an effect on accessibility.\n","BIO: Jennifer Hammelman (she/her) is a PhD student at MIT in the Computational and Systems Biology program.

Instead of explicitly specifying a prior that encodes the expected shape properties, the prior is defined automatically using the input point cloud, which we refer to as a self-prior. The self-prior encapsulates reoccurring geometric repetitions from a single shape within the weights of a deep neural network. We optimize the network weights to deform an initial mesh to shrink-wrap a single input point cloud. This explicitly considers the entire reconstructed shape, since shared local kernels are calculated to fit the overall object. The convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, which inherently encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the shape surface. We show that shrink-wrapping a point cloud with a self-prior converges to a desirable solution; compared to a prescribed smoothness prior, which often becomes trapped in undesirable local minima. While the performance of traditional reconstruction approaches degrades in non-ideal conditions that are often present in real world scanning, i.e., unoriented normals, noise and missing (low density) parts, Point2Mesh is robust to non-ideal conditions. We demonstrate the performance of Point2Mesh on a large variety of shapes with varying complexity.See project page for more details:\n","BIO: Rana Hanocka is a Ph.D. candidate at Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Daniel Cohen-Or and Raja Giryes.

The standard solution for off-chain payments, state channels, are optimized for frequent transactions between two entities and impose prohibitive liquidity and capital requirements on payment senders for marketplace transactions. We propose PayPlace, a scalable off-chain protocol for payments between consumers and sellers. Using PayPlace, consumers establish a virtual unidirectional payment channel with an intermediary operator to pay for their transactions. Unlike state channels, however, the PayPlace operator can reference the custodial funds accrued off-chain in these channels to in-turn make tamper-proof off-chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding capital in channels with merchants. Our design ensures that new payments made to merchants are guaranteed to be safe once notarized and provably mitigates well-known drawbacks in previous constructions like the data availability attack and ensures that neither consumers nor merchants need to be online to ensure continued safety of their notarized funds. We show that the on-chain monetary and computational costs for PayPlace is O(1) in the number of payment transactions processed, and is near-constant in other parameters in most scenarios. PayPlace can hence scale the payment throughput for large-scale marketplaces at no marginal cost and is orders of magnitude cheaper than the state-of-art solution for non-pairwise off-chain payments, Zero Knowledge Rollups.\n","BIO: I am a 5th year PhD Candidate at the ECE dept. of Carnegie Mellon University, jointly advised by Prof. Carlee Joe-Wong and Prof. Patrick Tague.

Because of its determinism, reliability and cost effectiveness, the Control Area Network (CAN) bus has become an attractive choice for real-time automotive communication between electronic control units. Recent studies have shown that the predictability of real-time systems can be exploited to degrade the performance of the system or compromise its integrity: having obtained certain schedule-related information or patterns about the system, an adversary can reconstruct its schedule and plan an attack with a higher chance of success. However, the ability to reconstruct a precise schedule is dependent on the amount of information at the attacker’s disposal. In this work, we studied the vulnerability of the CAN bus to such attacks. We investigated the limitations of the CAN bus message scheduling, and the ability of a potential attacker to infer information about a victim message’s parameters in order to perform target attacks or to manipulate safety-critical components on the car system.

Understanding fashion computationally would allow us better personalization, help the industry analyze its enterprise, and bring us closer towards building socially intelligent agents. Unfortunately, current computer vision systems for fashion are lacking in multiple ways.

Outfits are about the synergy between multiple garments, and I propose topic-model-based methods that automatically analyze the interplay between garments, and discover underlying combinations that form fashion styles.

In this paper, we study the impact of boundedly rational customer choice on the landscape of joint demand curves in competition, and its consequences on the properties of competing pricing algorithms derived from the online convex optimization (OCO) framework. In particular, we study price competition in a duopoly under a new customer behavior model motivated by online platforms offering perfectly substitutable services, e.g., ride-hailing. In this model, a customer samples the firms in an idiosyncratically preferred order until she finds one that is priced below her willingness-to-pay. We exhaustively characterize the equilibrium profile of the resulting pricing game when customers' willingness-to-pay distribution has a monotone hazard rate. We show that these games are frequently plagued by a particular strictly-local Nash equilibrium, in which the price of the firm with a smaller market share is only a local best-response to the competitor's price, when a globally optimal response with a potentially unboundedly higher payoff is available. Through numerical experiments, we show that price dynamics resulting from distributed online gradient descent may often converge to this undesirable outcome, and as a result cause the smaller firm to incur linear regret relative to her best-response price. Our results thus suggest that algorithms that adaptively rely on local information to learn good pricing decisions, {despite faring well in monopolistic settings}, may suffer from serious drawbacks in competitive environments.

In this study, we collected a dataset of 400 thousand users' 1.2 million replies to the 756 candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives in the two months leading up to the 2018 midterm election on Twitter. First we develop new techniques to quantify and categorize adversarial interactions against political candidates at scale. We show that some adversarial interactions against political figures may not be considered toxic in most other contexts hence bring challenge to automatic detection. The breadth of adversarial interactions we observed in the election includes offensive name-calling, threats of violence, posting discrediting information, attacks on identity, and adversarial message repetition. Secondly we characterize users who adversarially interact with political figures. We show that among moderately active users, adversarial activity is associated with decreased centrality in the social graph and increased attention to candidates from opponent party. When compared to users who are similarly active, highly adversarial users tend to engage in fewer supportive interactions with their own party's candidates and express negativity in their public user profile. \n","BIO: Yiqing is pursuing her PhD in Computer Science at Cornell University under Prof. Tom Ristenpart and Prof. Mor Naaman.

Previous studies have helped explore how programmers conduct computing activities, such as code comprehension and code review, but they rely on traditional survey instruments, which may not be reliable, rather than an understanding of fundamental cognitive processes. Advances in medical imaging and eye-tracking have recently been applied to software engineering, supporting grounded neurobiological and visual explorations of computing activities.

By examining the relationship between data structure manipulations and spatial ability, the cognitive processes in code writing and prose writing, and stereotypical associations in code review, with medical imaging (fMRI and fNIRS) and eye-tracking, we find that: (1) data structure and spatial operations use the same focal regions of the brain but to different degrees; (2) the neural representations of programming languages vs. natural languages are distinct; (3) biases and differences exist in how humans review code based on its apparent author and the gender of the reviewers when controlling for code quality.

In contrast, human perception is much more robust to such perturbations. The Bayesian brain hypothesis states that human brains use an internal generative model to update the posterior beliefs of the sensory input. This mechanism can be interpreted as a form of self-consistency between the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the internal generative model and the external environmental. Inspired by this, we enforce consistency in neural networks by incorporating generative recurrent feedback. We instantiate it on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed framework, termed Convolutional Neural Networks with Feedback (CNN-F), introduces a generative feedback with latent variables into existing CNN architectures, making consistent predictions via alternating MAP inference under a Bayesian framework. CNN-F shows considerably better adversarial robustness over regular feedforward CNNs on standard benchmarks.\n","BIO: Yujia Huang is a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Caltech, advised by Prof Anima Anandkumar.

These methods adaptively regularize the weights and converge close to the minimum l2 norm solution, even for initializations far from zero. For certain stepsizes of g and w , we show that they can converge close to the minimum norm solution.

Early video understanding technologies mostly focus on fully supervised trimmed action recognition using holistic frame modeling without reasoning capability. On the one hand, encoding the whole video scene in a holistic way with mixed subject, object and background will introduce background bias and cause the action recognition model to be brittle to different contexts. Understanding action in a compositional way with localized foreground subjects/objects can help reduce confounding variables and possibly bridge the connection with the common affordance knowledge of involved objects empowering the model reasoning ability. On the other hand, in practical applications, continuous video streams require to temporally localize actions before trimmed action recognition, yet such annotation is expensive and suffers from annotation consistency issues as well as inadequate description using only action labels. To overcome these issues, one possible direction is detecting action with less supervision and incorporating language to describe actions. In summary, the ultimate goal of my research is building robust action understanding algorithms with human level structural knowledge and multi-modal complementary ability. To achieve this goal, my research touches the following two aspects: (1) compositional action recognition with knowledge reasoning, and (2) multimodal action detection with less supervision.\n","BIO: She is a postdoctoral scholar in the EECS department at UC Berkeley advised by Prof. Trevor Darrell.

In our common production use cases, where streaming workloads have to meet latency targets and avoid breaching service-level agreements, existing solutions are incapable of handling the wide variability of user needs. Our framework called Cameo uses fine-grained stream processing (inspired by actor computation models), and is able to provide high resource utilization while meeting latency targets. Cameo dynamically calculates and propagates priorities of events based on user latency targets and query semantics. Experiments on Microsoft Azure show that compared to state-of-the-art, the Cameo framework: i) reduces query latency by 2.7X in single tenant settings, ii) reduces query latency by 4.6X in multi-tenant scenarios, and iii) weathers transient spikes of workload.\n","BIO: Le Xu is a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

State-of-the-art multiphoton holographic optogenetics requires high power illumination that only addresses relatively small populations of neurons in parallel. Conversely, one-photon holographic techniques can stimulate more neurons, but with a trade-off between resolution and addressable volume. We introduce a new one-photon light sculpting technique, Three-Dimensional Multi-site random Access Photostimulation (3D-MAP), that simultaneously overcomes all these limitations by dynamically modulating light in both the spatial and angular domain at multi-kHz rates. Electrophysiological measurements confirm that 3D-MAP achieves near single-cell resolution in vitro and in vivo.

Yet, existing NLIs are largely suffering from degraded performance when they are deployed to real applications, and meanwhile cannot inform users of their degradation as well as the likely hazards. Trying to address these problems, I argue that a practically effective and trustworthy NLI should be formulated as \"an intelligent agent\". The agent needs to be introspective of its uncertainties (i.e., sources of degradation) and can collaboratively interact with humans to resolve the uncertainties. It should also be able to learn from humans during the interaction.

Next, I focus on failure recovery of multiple interconnected networks. In particular, I focus on the interaction between a power grid and a communication network. Then, I focus on network monitoring techniques that can be used for diagnosing the performance of individual links for localizing soft failures (e.g. highly congested links) in a communication network.

Learning about real-world security incidents and data breaches can alert people to the ways in which their information is vulnerable online, thus playing a significant role in encouraging safe security behavior. This work examines 1) how often people read about security incidents online, 2) of those people, whether and to what extent they follow up with an action, e.g., by trying to learn more about the incident, and 3) what influences the likelihood that they will read about an incident and take some action.

However, the subtle differences between benign and cancerous tissue on prostate MRI results in an alarming variability in radiologist interpretation. Automated methods for prostate cancer detection on MRI can help standardize radiologist interpretation and assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning. However, existing automated methods mostly use inaccurate ground truth labels with MRI features alone, ignoring disease pathology characteristics observed on resected tissue. Here, we present CorrSigNet, a radiology-pathology fusion approach for detecting and localizing prostate cancer on MRI. CorrSigNet learns from patients with pathology after surgery, and then applies the learning to patients without pathology. This makes it clinically useful in prostate cancer detection, biopsy targeting and treatment planning. CorrSigNet uses registered pre-operative MRI and post-operative whole-mount histopathology images from prostate surgery patients to derive accurate ground truth labels and learn correlated features from the two modalities. CorrSigNet then uses the learned correlated features together with original MRI intensities in a deep learning framework to detect cancer on MRI. CorrSigNet outperforms existing prostate cancer detection methods, achieving a pixel-level AUC of 0.86 and a lesion-level AUC of 0.96 +- 0.07.\n","BIO: Dr. Indrani Bhattacharya is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford Universitywhere she holds a joint appointment at the Laboratory for Integrative Personalized Medicine and the Urologic Cancer Innovation Laboratory.

Indeed, emergent communication is now a vibrant field of research, with common settings involving discrete cheap-talk channels. One limitation of this setting is that it does not allow for the emergent protocols to generalize beyond the training partners. Furthermore, so far emergent communication has primarily focused on the use of symbolic channels (via discrete symbols, e.g. words). In this work, we extend this line of work to a new modality, by studying agents that learn to communicate via actuating their joints in a 3D simulated environment. We show that under realistic assumptions, a non-uniform distribution over intents and a common-knowledge energy cost, agents can learn communication protocols that generalize to novel partners. We also explore and analyze specific difficulties associated with finding globally optimal solutions in practice. Finally, we propose and evaluate initial training improvements to address these challenges, involving both specific training curricula and providing the latent features that can be coordinated upon during training.\n","BIO: Kalesha Bullard is a postdoctoral researcher at Facebook AI Research.

A common suggestion is to use a finite mixture model (FMM) with a prior on the number of components. Past work has shown the resulting FMM component-count posterior is consistent; that is, the posterior concentrates on the true generating number of components. But existing results crucially depend on the assumption that the component likelihoods are perfectly specified. In practice, this assumption is unrealistic, and empirical evidence suggests that the FMM posterior on the number of components is sensitive to the likelihood choice. In this paper, we add rigor to data-analysis folk wisdom by proving that under even the slightest model misspecification, the FMM component-count posterior diverges: the posterior probability of any particular finite number of latent components converges to 0 in the limit of infinite data.

Working towards this goal brings forth the need to adhere to the innate human characteristics of narratives. This opportunity urges us to model heterogeneous surrounding contexts from vision, auditory, and language signals. Through the course of my Ph.D. thus far, I proposed an anchoring framework to improve three fundamental components of 'Controllable Multimodal Natural Language Generation'. Specifically, I propose a 2D anchoring framework to distill the scope of this multi-dimensional problem to perform an attributable evaluation. The first dimension is discrete with the three narrative properties: (1) content i.e, relevance, (2) structure i.e, coherence and (3) surface form realization i.e, expression, seeking input from visual and textual modalities. The second dimension of modeling approaches determines the annotation complexity between supervised and unsupervised techniques giving rise to ‘locally’ (word level) and ‘globally’ (narrative level) conditioned training objectives. Contextualizing the effectiveness of this novel framework for each of the 3 properties, I present (1) Content: In situated multimodal contexts, relevance is the concept of the elements in one modality being connected to the other modality that makes this context complementary and informative. I present a simple yet effective technique of visual infilling with curriculum learning as a global objective and hierarchical skeleton-based learning as a local objective to generate visual stories and procedures. In order to improve the controllability, I also introduced a dual staged model that extracts a skeleton first to denoise the content in an image caption. (2) Structure: The alignment of description in language to the corresponding visual inputs is crucial to generate a logical and coherent narrative. I present a scaffolding technique as a local objective to extract a structural layout from vast amounts of unsupervised text to incorporate structure into cooking recipes generated from images. As a global objective, I proposed new techniques to improve reordering of sentences at various granularities. (3) Surface Form Realization: The crux of naturalness to automatic generation comes by incorporating individualized and personalized ways of expressing the same content. I worked on a dual staged GAN model to improve the generation of mixed-language text with a global sentence level objective, and speech with a local word-level objective.\n","BIO: Khyathi Chandu is a Ph.D. candidate at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

The integration of multiple energy carriers and facilities is reshaping our energy system from a highly regulated, operator-controlled network into a sophisticated social-interactive infrastructure with strategic agents competing for the supply and demand. Since the centralized operation approach does not allow each individual to act upon its profit-seeking nature, it no longer well fits the profound transition to the prosumer era. Market, as an invisible hand, is a promising tool for managing resources more efficiently. Inspired by the sharing economy in other sectors, we may want to ask: can energy be shared in a similar way? We explore the potential of energy sharing by answering why, how, and what if. For why, three typical approaches, i.e., self-sufficiency, sharing, centralized operation, are compared under a stochastic framework with uncertain loads, and sharing stands out for the fact that it can achieve a nearly social optimal efficiency in a distributed manner. For how, we design effective mechanisms for sharing among node-level and networked prosumers, respectively. Several desirable properties of the sharing market equilibrium are proved theoretically. We also develop a bidding process for implementation with proof of its convergence under mild conditions. For what if, a two-stage robust economic dispatch problem is used as an example, by replacing the centralized real-time operation with a distributed sharing scheme. It has been proved that the flexibility of the system is retained with only slightly sacrifice of economy.

Despite their significant impact, these systems are often used without much reasoning about their behaviors. For instance, while models are defined over a set of features, often they must make decisions with missing features as observing a feature often has a cost in real-world scenarios, such as medical diagnosis. Thus, different subsets of features may be observed for individuals, in which case one may wonder how robust the decision is against potential outcomes of unobserved features. In addition, automated systems can perpetuate social bias from historical data or even introduce new ones, making decisions that may put certain groups at an unfair disadvantage. Hence, both robustness and fairness are crucial in building trustworthy decision-making systems. Moreover, they both involve reasoning about the behavior of a model with uncertainty, i.e., with respect to an underlying distribution. My research seeks to develop probabilistic reasoning algorithms for quantifying and verifying robustness and fairness, and in turn, to use those to learn decision-making systems that can give guarantees.

A rising recent trend involves executing inferencing pipelines (to perform increasingly complex tasks, such as object recognition or target localization), in-situ and in real time, at such edge nodes. There are two salient features associated with these trends: (1) Sensors are often deployed with varying degrees of redundant coverage--e.g., cameras in buildings often have partially overlapping fields of view, implying that their sensed data are implicitly spatiotemporally correlated, and (2) inferencing increasingly involves the execution of computationally prohibitive machine learning (ML) pipelines (e.g., CNNs for image-based object detection).

The feature set is defined by billing code information from labeled CVID patients as well as the symptoms reported in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) which provides clinical descriptions of thousands of rare diseases. Second, we incorporate Immunoglobulin G (IgG) measurements from laboratory tests as a risk factor. We implement a joint analysis that leverages information across all features and labeled case data to compute a weight for each feature through a penalized regression framework. Comparing PheNet against the current state-of-the-art methods, we observe a 3-fold increase in the detection of true cases. We then conducted a retrospective analysis to assess the utility of PheNet as a predictive tool. We aggregated every patient’s EHR data in 30-day intervals, and computed each patient’s risk score using PheNet at each interval. We reviewed the labeled CVID cases who had a PheNet score in the 99.5th percentile at any point in time, and identified 21 patients whose score was in the top percentile before any billing code for immunodeficiency was present. As a clinical tool, our approach provides unprecedented information that can be utilized with minimal resources in hospitals and clinics that are far away from large academic medical centers.\n","BIO: I am currently a computer science PhD student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

NMT training data typically comes in the form of parallel text---sentences translated between the two languages of interest. Limited quantities of parallel text are available for most language pairs, leading to a low-resource problem.

Plasmonics is a promising avenue to achieve sub-wavelength control of light-matter interactions. When surface plasmon oscillations are bound to an atomically thin van der Waals material, extreme confinement and tunability of the electromagnetic energy can be achieved. As the optical properties of graphene are dominated by plasmon excitations in the mid-infrared spectral range, researchers became excited about the possibilities for plasmon-based light emission mechanisms. In the first part of the presentation, I will present theoretical predictions and experimental validations of mid-infrared hot-plasmon-assisted light emission in graphene. Such emission processes emerge from an ultrafast coupling of optically excited carriers into plasmon excitations, producing non-Planckian emission behavior that is not dictated by emitters’ temperatures.

We create simple examples which highlight generalization issues as a major source of this tradeoff. For adversarial examples, we show that even augmenting with correctly annotated data to promote robustness can produce less accurate models, but we develop a simple method, robust self-training, that mitigates this tradeoff using unlabeled data. For minority groups, we show that overparametrization of models can hurt accuracy on the minority groups, though it improves standard accuracy.

Therefore, they do not perform well in challenging scenarios with e.g. lighting changes or motion blur. Recent deep learning approaches that rely on kernels to represent motion can only alleviate these problems to some extent. In those cases, methods that use a per-pixel phase-based motion representation have been shown to work well. However, they are only applicable for a limited amount of motion. This work proposes a new approach, PhaseNet, that is designed to robustly handle challenging scenarios while also coping with larger motion compared to previous phase-based methods. Instead of working with color pixel values we use the phase-based decomposition of images as input and output to our network. The presented approach consists of a neural network decoder that directly estimates the phase decomposition of the intermediate frame. The results show that this is superior to the hand-crafted heuristics previously used in phase-based methods and also compares favorably to recent deep learning-based approaches for video frame interpolation on challenging datasets.\n","BIO: Simone Schaub-Meyer is a postdoctoral researcher at the Visual Inference Lab at the Technical University of Darmstadt since September 2020.

Their importance has driven a conservative deployment approach, with redundancy and reliability baked in at multiple layers. In this work, we take a more aggressive approach and argue for adapting the capacity of fiber optic links based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We investigate this idea by analyzing the SNR of over 8,000 links in an optical backbone for a period of three years. We show that the capacity of 64% of 100 Gbps IP links can be augmented by at least 75 Gbps. Moreover, adapting link capacity to a lower rate can prevent up to 25% of link failures. Our analysis shows that using the same links, we get higher capacity, better availability, and 32% lower cost per gigabit per second. To accomplish this, we propose Rate Adaptive WAN (RADWAN), a traffic engineering system that allows optical links to adapt their rate based on the observed SNR to achieve higher throughput and availability while minimizing the churn during capacity reconfigurations. We evaluate RADWAN using a testbed consisting of 1,540 km fiber with 16 amplifiers and attenuators. We then simulate the throughput gains of RADWAN at scale and compare them to the gains of state-of-the-art traffic engineering systems. Our data-driven simulations show that RADWAN improves the overall network throughput by 40% while also improving the average link availability.\n","BIO: Rachee Singh is a researcher in the Mobility and Networking group at MSR Redmond.

Does labeling a post with the author's gender affect the post popularity? This paper develops a method to estimate such causal effects from observational text data, adjusting for confounding features of the text such as the subject or writing quality. We assume that the text suffices for causal adjustment but that, in practice, it is prohibitively high-dimensional. To address this challenge, we develop causally sufficient embeddings, low-dimensional document representations that preserve sufficient information for causal identification and allow for efficient estimation of causal effects. Causally sufficient embeddings combine two ideas. The first is supervised dimensionality reduction: causal adjustment requires only the aspects of text that are predictive of both the treatment and outcome. The second is efficient language modeling: representations of text are designed to dispose of linguistically irrelevant information, and this information is also causally irrelevant. Our method adapts language models (specifically, word embeddings and topic models) to learn document embeddings that are able to predict both treatment and outcome. We study causally sufficient embeddings with semi-synthetic datasets and find that they improve causal estimation over related embedding methods. We illustrate the methods by answering the two motivating questions---the effect of a theorem on paper acceptance and the effect of a gender label on post popularity.\n","BIO: I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Data Science Institute at Columbia University, working with David Blei.

Trace wringing uses a simple metric to quantify information leakage—number of bits. Our pipeline leverages computer vision techniques to describe repetitive program patterns succinctly into lossily-compressed “packets”. The size of the packet in bits provides an upper bound on information leakage. Our argument is simple: if we only share n bits about the trace, then we cannot leak more than n bits about that trace.

The problem is fundamental – silicon phase modulators rely on either slow, yet highly power consuming thermo-optic effect to induce pure phase change or relatively faster plasma dispersion effect, which not only changes the phase of the propagating mode but also induces significant absorption. The need of the hour is a material or a photonic structure that can induce significant phase change with minimal absorption and has relatively low electrical power consumption (∼ 1 fJ/bit). 2D materials are promising for optical modulation, detection and light emission because their optical properties can be tailored on-demand by electrostatically doping the monolayers. The ease of integration, strong light-matter interaction and large-scale growth of 2D materials enable their widespread applicability in emerging large scale systems. Till date, researchers have pre-dominantly concentrated on the electro-absorptive properties of semi-metal graphene and TMDs near their excitonic resonances, where the optical insertion loss is prohibitively high for photonic applications.

This puts a great burden on systems designers and researchers to manage such complexity. Machine learning (ML) creates an opportunity to alleviate this burden by modeling resources' complicated, non-linear interactions and deliver an optimal solution to scheduling and resource management problems. However, naively applying traditional ML methods, such as deep learning, creates several challenges including generalization, robustness, and interpretability. A lack of generalizability and robustness in the ML models is largely due to the scarcity and bias of the training data. Causal inference creates an opportunity to tackle these challenges by analyzing observational data rather than data generated from randomized experiments. Since causal inference inherently studies the causal relationships---underlying structure---rather than correlation between features, it also provides interpretable systems results. This poster describes my PhD research on applying ML to systems along with key techniques from causal inference, characterizing my specific goals of: (1) learning for systems optimization with scarce data and system structure, and (2) learning for straggler prediction with imbalanced data.\n","BIO: Yi Ding is currently a final year PhD student in Computer Science from the University of Chicago.

To satisfy these requirements, memory hierarchies become more complex, incorporating emerging types of technologies or disaggregation techniques to offset the skyrocketing cost that DRAM-only systems would impose. As we shift away from traditional memory hierarchies, the effectiveness of existing data management solutions decreases, as these have not provisioned against the even bigger disparity in the access speeds of the heterogeneous components that are now part of the memory subsystem. Additionally, system-level configuration knobs need to be re-tuned to adjust to the speeds of the newly introduced memory hardware. In the face of this complexity, conventional approaches to designing data management solutions with empirically-derived configuration parameters become impractical. This makes the case for leveraging machine intelligence in building a new generation of data management solutions for hybrid memory systems. This thesis identifies the machine intelligent methods that can be effective for and practically integrated with system-level memory management, and demonstrates their importance through the design of new components of the memory management stack; from system-level support for configuring stack parameters to memory scheduling.\n","BIO: Thaleia Dimitra Doudali is a final year PhD student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech advised by Ada Gavrilovska.

Often, the incorporation of even dilute concentrations of highly mismatch elements results in significant changes in the electronic, optical, and structural properties of highly mismatched alloys. For example, the addition of 1-3% of nitrogen to GaAs simultaneously reduces the lattice parameter and band gap energy in GaAsN alloys, making them appealing candidates for novel heterostructure devices. Of particular interest is the potential for monolithic integration of direct bandgap III-V alloys on silicon for the realization of smaller, cheaper, and more powerful (opto)electronic devices. Boron is highly mismatched in size, but not electronegativity, as compared to conventional column IIIA elements, resulting in binary B-V compounds with lattice parameters much smaller than conventional III-V semiconductors. The small lattice-constants of the B-V compounds offer a rare opportunity for tensile strain-engineering of III-V alloys. As the B concentration in these alloys is increased beyond the dilute limit, alloys such as BGaInAs can potentially be grown lattice-matched, or nearly lattice-matched to Si, enabling the monolithic integration of optoelectronic devices on Si. At the same time, the lattice-constant reduction achieved through alloying III-V material with B presents opportunities for increased flexibility in substrate-choice across a wide-range of III-V lattice-constants, enabling previously unrealizable device designs including same-chip photodetectors and lasers for telecommunications (on GaAs), 2 μm LiDAR (on GaAs, InP), and long-wave infrared (B)InAsSb active-regions (on GaSb). To date, the realization of such devices has been limited by the challenging synthesis of these alloys. Here we present an optimized epitaxial growth approach, enabling record B concentrations in BGaAs and BGaInAs. We leverage this optimized growth process to explore fundamental properties of these alloys and demonstrate prototype optoelectronic devices.\n","BIO: Rasha El-Jaroudi is an electrical engineering PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin studying III-V optoelectronic devices.

We prove that this approach is equivalent, in a strong sense, to working with polyhedral (piecewise linear convex) losses. Moreover, given any polyhedral loss L, we give a construction of a link function through which L is a consistent surrogate for the loss it embeds.

Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are able to collaboratively plan and execute driving maneuvers by sharing their perceptual knowledge and future plans. By using the theory of model predictive control (MPC) and strong duality, I’ve developed provably safe algorithms for collaborative navigation of multiple heterogeneous autonomous mobile robots with different (arbitrary) polytopic shapes and different dynamical models in tight environments. The coordination strategies are classified in two categories of centralized and distributed. I’ve developed optimization-based centralized coordination strategies for formation, reconfiguration and autonomous navigation of CAVs, travelling on public roads. Using the proposed approach, CAVs are able to form single or multi-lane platoons of various geometrical configurations. They are able to reshape and adjust their configurations according to changes in the environment. In addition, I’ve designed the distributed coordination algorithm that exploits the problem structure to decompose the large optimization problem into smaller local subproblems solved in parallel. Using this approach, the robots can cooperate (while communicating their intentions to the neighbors) and compute collision-free paths in a distributed way to navigate in tight environments in real time.\n","BIO: Roya Firoozi is a Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Berkeley, advised by Professor Francesco Borrelli.
